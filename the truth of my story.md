# The Truth of My Story

## Who am I?
hello, everyone, weizard here, im a self learn coder, "Magic project" is one of my hobby,
our company provide IDC structured cabling solution to contractor or system integrator in worldwide.
that Faker_Dev guy in this channel is trying all way to recover his "reputation",
now he pull me out and said that i was doing the same thing as he did, 
well, u r the boss, i will show what i was doing.


## Here is truth of my story
"Magic" is just a personal fork of overclocking configurator with some custom functions at the beginning, but now it's more, sponsors log &github log screenshots are on the bottom.(DM me to get ur token to access to my source code and tell ppl the truth if u r mod or real dev, coz it's a private repo on github.)

"Magic project" was created not too long after OCS change to EOS,
at the very begining, it only has 1 branch **magic** and **it's TOTALLY FREE** all the time,
but i start to realize that this is difficult to do new features testing with only one branch and i did fuck up some ppl's settings, sorry, guys!

About 1 month later. i created **magic-beta for testing new features**  and will merge updates to magic release version, once we confirm it's stable.
so u can always get updates, could be just a little bit later(u can find it from my github log), it depends on what we are working on.

## Why access to sponsor only?
it starts from some ppl in my community want to buy me a drink to support my work and thank me, so i create [afdian channel](https://afdian.net/a/weizard) and set up sponsors, but set it to the lowest price on afdian which is CNY 5(about $0.7) per month, i never expect to make money from this.

In the end, i decided only access to sponsors, because i don't wanna fuck up new users.  (most of sponsors help me testing since alpha version and they all got access to this project, even they are not sponsor.)

what i use to share the project is a link of my web drive folder which can always get the updates from what i push on github, and since most of them are not avaiable to access github due to the GFW, so i guess this the simplest way to help them.

## sso_O is not my alt
i don't use alt, i had nothing to hide, don't be mislead.

## Why is this Faker_Dev after me?
Well, it starts from i expose what he did to DBI and cause no more zhCN version to all our ppl,
And this impact to his bussiness and his "reputation", so he declaim will revenge to anyone who relate to it. :)

i don't wanna argue with anyone and i really think doing this is completely wasting my time,
but i still hope ppl take some time to do some research instead of judge things from few sentences.

here is my monthly sponsors log since day one on afdian, i didn't withdraw 1 cent from it.
